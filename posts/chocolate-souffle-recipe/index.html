      <h1>Chocolate Soufflé</h1>
      <p>Makes 8 servings.</p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Unsalted&nbsp;<b>butter </b>at room temperature to grease the ramekins</li>
        <li><b>Sugar </b>to coat the greased ramekins</li>
        <li>6 ounces of <b>semisweet chocolate pieces</b></li>
        <li>6 large <b>eggs</b></li>
        <li>2/3 cup of <b>sugar</b></li>
        <li>Half a teaspoon of <b>kosher salt</b></li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of <b>whole milk</b> (or heavy cream)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of <b>pure vanilla extract</b></li>
      </ul>
      <h3> Recipe </h3>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Butter the inner surfaces each ramekin. Sprinkle the inside of each ramekin evenly with sugar. Set the ramekins on a baking sheet.</p>
		<p>Place chocolate in a bowl over a pot of simmering water. It may help to add a tablespoon of butter to the chocolate pieces. Heat over medium heat until the chocolate melts.</p>
		<p>Separate the egg yolks into a stand mixer bowl and egg whites into a large mixing bowl. Add the salt and half a cup of the sugar to the egg yolks. Beat egg yolks on medium-high speed until light and fluffy (about 3-4 minutes). It should take 3 seconds for peaks to dissolve when lifted. Stir vanilla and milk into the melted chocolate and transfer to a large mixing bowl. Fold in 1/3 of the egg yolk mixture into the chocolate mixture and repeat twice. Using a stand mixer with a wire attachment, beat the egg whites on medium speed until fluffy, for about 3-4 minutes. Add remaining 1 tablespoon of sugar to egg whites. Beat egg whites for 1 more minute on medium speed until shiny. It should form peaks when lifted. Fold egg whites into chocolate mixture.</p>
		<p>Divide mixture evenly among prepared ramekins. You can refrigerate for a few hours if you want to bake later. If you refrigerated, bake for 20-25 minutes. Else, bake for 15-17 minutes, or until soufflés are puffed and cracked on top. Serve immediately.</p>
